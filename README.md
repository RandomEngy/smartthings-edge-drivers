# SmartThingsEdgeDrivers
---
An extension of the preliminary edge driver originally established by [ryanjmulder](https://community.smartthings.com/u/ryanjmulder) and forked from [his GitHub repo](https://github.com/ryanjmulder/smartthings-edge-drivers).

The goal of these drivers is to include the unique HomeSeer Z-Wave attributes not currently accounted for in the [SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsEdgeDrivers](https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/SmartThingsEdgeDrivers).
